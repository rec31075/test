# LDSGeneralConferenceDownloader
A script to download General Conference talks for offline listening.

## Who is this for?
This script is ideal for:
 - Going on *long journeys* without reliable internet connection,
 - *Full-time missionaries* who want to listen to conference talks during study time,
 - *Anyone* who wishes to study from the conference talks but doesn't have a reliable internet connection.
  
## What it can do?
This script will allow you to download the LDS General Conference talks in mp3 form that are available at https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference.
It will create *playlists* as *.m3u files to allow you to play an *entire session*. 
It will also create playlists for *speakers* and *topics*.
This will not only work with the default English versions, but also for *every other language* for which audio files are available.
Currently, hundreds of talks are available in many languages, going back as far as 1971 for some.

## How does it work?
It will programmatically navigate the churchofjesuschrist.org website, downloading and organising every talk of interest to you.
Everything will be saved to a local folder of your choice. 
Load these files onto a *memory stick* for your car, or into your *favourite media player*.
